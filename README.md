# Self-Organizing-Maps


Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) is a type of artificial neural network that is trained to cluster
high-dimensional input data into a two-dimensional grid of nodes, known as a map or a lattice. 
The SOM algorithm is a form of unsupervised learning, meaning that it does not require labeled data to train on. 
Instead, the SOM learns to organize the input data into a map of nodes, where nearby nodes have similar weights, 
and the weights of the nodes further away are progressively dissimilar.

The SOM algorithm works by iteratively adjusting the weights of the nodes in the map to minimize
the difference between the input data and the node weights. During the training process,
each input is presented to the network, and the node with the most similar weight to the input is identified as the "winner". 
The weights of the winning node, and the nodes surrounding it, are then updated to better match the input.
This process is repeated many times until the map stabilizes, and the nodes converge to represent clusters of similar input data.

Once the SOM is trained, it can be used for various tasks such as data visualization, data compression, and data clustering. 
For example, the SOM can be used to visualize high-dimensional data by projecting it onto a two-dimensional map, where similar data points are clustered together. 
Alternatively, the SOM can be used to compress high-dimensional data by encoding it as the weights of the nodes in the map. Finally, 
the SOM can be used for data clustering by assigning each input data point to the node in the map with the most similar weight.
